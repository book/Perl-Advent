Title: Watching The Perl Conference Again
Topic: App::HTTPThis and App::HTTPSThis

Another year, another successful Christmas Eve.  It was time for the Wise Old
Elf to pack his bags and head off for his southern-hemisphere summer holiday
once again.

This year, L<like last year|http://www.perladvent.org/2017/2017-12-24.html>,
before he left he decided to download a bunch of videos to watch on the beach.
What better to entertain himself than the talks from last year's Perl
Conference?

Downloading these with Perl was just as easy as last year:

    perl -Mojo -E \
      'g(shift)->dom(".pl-video-title-link")->map(sub{say $_->attr("href")})' \
      'https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA9_Hq3zhoFx1inHPmwmbXrPcI8cc0fyO' \
      | xargs -n 1 youtube-download

On the beach, Mrs Wiser Elf looked over the Wise Old Elf's shoulder.

"Watcha watching?", she asked.

"The videos from the The Perl Conference in Salt Lake City this year.  I'm
watching this L<talk|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdh0w69h5xI&index=28&list=PLA9_Hq3zhoFx1inHPmwmbXrPcI8cc0fyO&t=0s>
on the relaunching of L<perl.com|http://www.perl.com>."

"Oh! Interesting" she said.  Mrs Wiser Elf had been one of the best Perl
programmers Santa had had before she'd moved over to designing the custom
chipsets that Santa uses in his datacenters.

"I'd love to watch a few of those on my tablet", she continued, "but the
bandwidth here is I<terrible>."

"Don't worry my sweet, you can play them right off of my laptop."

The Wise Old Elf had installed L<App::HTTPThis> which would allow him to
quickly serve any directory as a website.  In the shell The Wise Old Elf
changed directory to where he'd downloaded the videos and typed one command:

    bash$ http_this
    Exporting '.', available at:
       http://127.0.0.1:7007/

The Wise Old Elf clicked the link and was greeted by a listing of all the
files in his browser.

"Okay my gumdrop, you can head over to http://wiseoldlaptop.local port 7007
to see all the videos"

"I shall do no such thing! What have I always told you about using https these
days.  Anyone could be snooping on what we're doing."

"Sorry my love".

The Wise Old Elf quickly typed hit ctrl-c to kill the webserver and typed
a different command:

    bash$ https_this

    You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated

    What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
    There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
    For some fields there will be a default value,
    If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.

The L<App::HTTPSThis> module had just automatically created a I<snake oil>
certificate, meaning that the connection was encrypted, but still vunerable to
man-in-the-middle attacks when the connection was first established - not that
that mattered in this case.

"Okay my pecan pie, you can go to B<https>://wiseoldlaptop.local port 8443 now"

And with that, the two elves could get back to taking a well earned rest...until
it was time to get ready for next year.
