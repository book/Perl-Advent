Title: Spot The Difference
Topic: App::ccdiff
Author: Mark Fowler <mark@twoshortplanks.com>

"Sometimes", Binky the Elf thought to himself, "you end up making life
difficult for yourself".

Sure, implementing the new low-bandwidth communications protocol to Santa's
sleigh had been Binky's best idea yet, but, of course, someone had to support
the system when it went wrong.  And that someone?  The Elf whose bright idea
it was in the first place.

The problem that Binky's team was solving was that Santa's crew had needed to
constantly update the status of
present delivery back to the North Pole, but the sleigh kept entering
communication dead zones where they couldn't make use of the HTTP endpoints
they'd originally setup.  Binky has addressed this problem by encoding each present delivery
status as a single character, and sending a constant stream of present updates
back to home base.  Rather than two hundred HTTP calls, the stream
just sent back the following highly compact data:

    tweiadzjxiwxbbqrhlrrjcprgmctbtusbvwkvxwu
    afnysopgavusxkcejwbsbxajoncdkiiwzbkhjzem
    ijcqrbnkiynhpvnyazgejwbtzkcnagtnjcqxvrwm
    qcxdvczunrrkcusgmzhsglznliheqivqhkhavvas
    urwybcffdnqkqwnqdblzmgppolxhbkkhktjqqozp

Highly compact data, however, that Binky was finding out to be really hard to debug.  On one of
the sleigh's many dry runs it had returned the wrong data I<somewhere> in the
stream of less-than-readable letters, and Binky had to track each of them down.

Binky stared in his terminal at the files C<a.txt> and C<b.txt> that
represented the expected and actual output for the first of the several hundred
delivery sites with corrupt data.

Finding the line with the different character was simple - that's what C<diff>
is for:

    shell$ diff -u a.txt b.txt
    --- a.txt	2018-12-05 05:59:11.000000000 -0500
    +++ b.txt	2018-12-05 05:59:26.000000000 -0500

But finding the actual differing character on that line that...that was much harder.

Binky tried
moving character by character with his finger on the screen comparing each line with the one above it, but by the
time he got half way through his had eyes glazed over.  And there wasn't just one of these files...there were hundreds to go! Either he was going to have to prop his eyes open with candy canes or he
was going to have to be smarter.

It was time for Binky to use one of the virtues of a Perl programmer: Laziness!
Time to search the CPAN for a solution.

One of the humans, H.Merijn Brand, had had a similar problem when debugging
terminal capabilities files (which also tend to be somewhat unreadable).  In the
end he'd written a diff utility C<ccdiff> that could not only identify what
I<line> had changed in the file, but could also indicate what I<characters> had
changed on the line.

Binky was over the moon.  With this tool he'd be able to spot the changes right
away.

C<ccdiff> is quite configurable and has some handy extra features.  You can
configure the color scheme for the various different characters.  Very handy
if you're even slightly red-green colorblind (like the author of this article.)

C<ccdiff> even has settings suitable for generating output that's easy to
copy and paste into an email, bug tracker, or other tool that'll lose the
color information

    shell$ ccdiff --ascii --no-color -m -u a.txt b.txt
    --- a.txt	Wed Dec  5 05:59:11 2018
    +++ b.txt	Wed Dec  5 05:59:26 2018

Awesome!  Now Binky was able to open a github issue with the problem identified.
Unfortunatly, some poor elf had to actually I<fix> that bug, and it looked
like it might be another long night for Binky...
