Contrary to popular perception, Santa doesn't actually know your name.
Do you have any idea how many Timothy Cratchit's there are in New Jersey alone?
No, he keeps track of everybody via a hash of some vital info, but
<tt>8577145dd4d2191dbd6f7a8ad293c0f4c266b233</tt> is a little difficult to
remember and pronounce, so he prefers to use M<Digest::BubbleBabble>; even
though it's sole function must be explicitly imported, and unlike other
<tt>Digest</tt> routines it expects its single argument to be passed as a
key-value pair. Therefore one well known individual bearing this monikerN<msg>
was actually known up North as
<tt>xocel-lyheh-tohat-dikec-tazak-zovym-pogun-faboz-gubik-kosaf-faxox</tt>.
It might not roll off the tongue at first, but it's certainly unique.
