If your shop is anything like Santa's, you probably have a number of legacy
systems kicking about concerns of a special breed of feature creep: the
incorporation of nifty but non-nessential modern syntax in new code
precluding its use with older versions of perl. Fortunately a certain clever
Aussie&mdash;no not him, the other one&mdash;has seen fit to provide a tool
to check for just such issues, M<Perl::MinimumVersion>. Since it's built on
<tt>PPI</tt>, it theoretically has the ability to recognize whether potentially
offending code is protected by an C<eval>, like the else block below:

=begin code

#MAGIC minifig0
  $self->{_file} = _canonical($self->{-d}, $self->{-f}, qr/\.[ft]lf/,
                              $^O =~ /MSWin32|DOS/i);
  $self->{_file} = (glob($self->{_file}.'.?lf'))[0] unless -e $self->{_file};

  $self->{_fh} = gensym;            #5.005 support
  eval "use IO::Uncompress::Unzip";
  unless( $@ ){
      $self->{_fh} = eval{ IO::Uncompress::Unzip->new($self->{_file}) } ||
          confess("No such file or directory: $self->{_file}");
  }
  else{
      open($self->{_fh}, '<'.$self->{_file}) || confess("$!: $self->{_file}");
      #$^W isn't mutable at runtime in 5.005, so we have to conditional eval
      #to avoid "Useless use of constant in void context"
      eval "binmode(\$fh, ':encoding(utf8)')" unless $] < 5.006;
  }
#MAGIC minifig1

=end code

Alas, the reason M<App::MinimumVersion|perlver> currently thinks the above
code&mdash;from <tt>Text::FIGlet</tt>, which purposefully maintains backwards
compatability&mdash;is Perl 5.0053 compataible because it's not aware of IO
layers, not because it sees the modern syntax is safely inside a string C<eval>.

=begin pre

% perlver lib/Text/FIGlet/Font.pm 


   ------------------------------------------------------  
 | file                    | explicit | syntax | external |
 | ------------------------------------------------------ |
 | lib/Text/FIGlet/Font.pm | ~        | v5.5.3 | n/a      |
 | ------------------------------------------------------ |
 | Minimum explicit version : ~                             |
 | Minimum syntax version   : v5.5.3                        |
 | Minimum version of perl  : v5.5.3                        |
   ------------------------------------------------------  

=end pre

However it will pick up on a number of issues like 3-arg open or INIT blocks,
and could be easily updated by some kindly elves to cover more cases. Even
its current state though, M<App::MinimumVersion> would be a nice addition
to pre-check-in automated tests of code kwalitee.
