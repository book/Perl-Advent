Today we bring you a humble stocking stuffer, M<Devel::Eval>. A module which
permits you to step through C<eval>uated strings as you might any other code.
Unfortunately C<eval> is one of the core functions that cannot be overridden,
so to access this functionality you must change your calls from C<eval> to
C<dval>&mdash;which might lead you to try to C<use>
<tt>Devel::Dval</tt> instead&mdash; after explicitly importing the subroutine.
