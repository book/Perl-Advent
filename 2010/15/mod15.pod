You're probably aware that saintly coders don't use tained data,
but were you aware that you should also clean your environment?
M<Env::Sanctify> simplifies the process of cleaning I<%ENV> with
regular expressions, and restoring it later. If you're only

M<Env::Sanctify::Auto> will delint your environment automatically.
