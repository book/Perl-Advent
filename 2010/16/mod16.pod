Santa needed to implement a server to collect naughty/nice lists from
all over the world. The IT elves needed a quick solution that allowed
Naughty Montoring Service offices in far flung corners across the globe
to report their extensive child behavioral data to HQ for analysis.

In the end the North Pole settled on M<Net::Server>, a comprehensive,
flexible, and robust framework used by numerous other packages such as
<tt>Catalyst::Engine::Server</tt> and <tt>Starman</tt>. It handles the
gritty details of listening on one or more sockets, forking and daemonising,
buffering, logging and even more. In some cases it takes more control of
things than you might want (like signal handling), but before you give-up
and roll your own, ask yourself: Do you B<really> need your server to be
an ornament polish and a gingerbread house spackle?

M<Net::Server> has extensive documentation, but our example script below
should hopefully provide a comparatively short introduction.
