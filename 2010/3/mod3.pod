Santa doesn't have much work for his computer elves in the off-season, so he recently started contracting
them out for the first three quarters of the year. Unfortunately for poor P<2008-13|Gluggag&aelig;gir>
most customers aren't using Unix-family systems. Worse still, he often has to create and support WordPress
installations. Glugg was eventually able to convince some clients to A<http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/one-time-password/|install a plug-in for one-time password support>.
Of course, the desktops were not Debian and therefore lacked a native S/Key. Of course, being a good perl
hack Glugg checked CPAN and found <tt>Crypt::SKey</tt>, but he needed to find a way to make its
functionality accessible to his command prompt fearing Windows users.
<tt><a href="http://www.darserman.com/Perl/Loft/">The GUI Loft</a></tt> to the rescue! <tt>Loft</tt>
provides an intuitive GUI-based GUI designer shown in the screen shot below. With it you can produce
a a non-threatening skin for you application with native platform controls based on M<Win32::GUI>.

Thanks to WINE, Glugg had a snazzy interface for generating passkeys after a few minutes of banging
around with a mouse on his Xm/OS laptop. Finally, he need only implement some event callbacks and his
mission to bring security to the masses was complete.

<hr>

The specification for a <tt>Loft</tt> application's skin is stored in a small binary file which you
can easily load using the <tt>Win32::GUI::Loft::Design</tt> class, although other methods are available
to you. One short-coming of this otherwise easy-as-pie system though, is that
A<http://www.darserman.com/Perl/Loft/reference.html#loading_the_file_yourself|despite the documentation's example>,
the filename parameter to newScalar() is not optional. This means it is not possible to inline your
<tt>Loft</tt> design file into F<DATA> in an attempt to simplify distribution of your program.

Another minor peeve is that the position of the application in the window designer is stored in
the binary and it serves as default location for the application window when it starts, although
one could argue that this is a feature. If you find it a nuisance, you'll have to reposition the
window programatically.

Finally, it shold be noted that <a href="http://www.pegland.net/Technical/OPIE/opie_login.html#key_generators">winkey32.exe</a> provides the same functionality as our example script, without all the dependencies/performance hit from PAR.

A PARchive of the script, it does not seem to work under WINE though.
