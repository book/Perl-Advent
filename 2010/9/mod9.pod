Spending most of his time staring at a blinking prompt,
Glugg used to use command line tools to email himself todos.
Alas, the system quickly became unmanageable even with ability
to bring the full power of the GNU toolset to bear on his
<span title="the true UNIX mail system">MH folders</span>.
He was familiar with C<A<http://ginatrapani.github.com/todo.txt-cli/|todo.sh>>
but liked having the ability to add tasks from anywhere with
access to email. Therefore Glugg was thrilled when he found
M<App::Todo|todo.pl>, a C<todo.sh> like interface to the
web-based A<http://hiveminder.com|Hiveminder> service.
Besides the ability to add tasks by email, and hand-out
special email addresses to others for them to submit tasks
to as well, Glugg was fond of the I<braindump> action which
allowed him to create multiple (un)related tasks at once in
his favorite text editorN<py>.

=begin pre

% todo.pl ls --tag xmas
#XYZZX Mull cider [xmas]
#XYZZY Get tree [xmas]

% todo.pl braindump

=end pre

<blockquote class="w">
String popcorn & cranberries [xmas]
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;but first: #XYZZY
<br />Wrap gifts [xmas]
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;but first: Buy them [xmas]
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;and then: Ship them [xmas]

Even if this did lead him to start questioning the evils of whitespace as syntax.
