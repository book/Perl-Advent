The jolly old elf's a big fan of open source and open data, but traditionally
mapping gadgets have all been proprietary. Therefore his IT elves have been
keeping an eye on projects like OpenStreetMap. They were recently pleased to
discover M<Champlain>,
A<http://projects.gnome.org/libchamplain/reference.html|thin Perl bindings to libchamplain>.
libchamplain is a library for accessing Free data from OSM and other projects.

Installing the module was a little hairy though, since dependencies on
<tt>Clutter</tt>, <tt>ExtUtils::Depends</tt>, and <tt>ExtUtils::PkgConfig</tt>
are not declared, and the version of libchamplain shipping with Xm/OS is
too old for the module, even though it uses an oudated verson itself. As noted
in the POD, the A[BP]I of the library is not yet set, so the specific version
used by the developer&mdash;0.5&mdash;is required. Once the dependencies were
installed though, the module built successfully and the elves were quickly
able to display a map, putting them on their way to creating a new GPS platform
for the boss.
