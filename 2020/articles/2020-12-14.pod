2020 has been time consuming - a global pandemic, giant fires, horrific floods
and political unrest - which has left us little time for side projects.
This year we're looking back to happier times into the 20+ year archive with the
Best of the Perl Advent Calendar.

Have you ever wanted to use Perl to change a line in the middle of a
data file?  While this may sound like a trivial thing for a human to do (or
for a text editor) it's actually quite hard to do programattically.

While you and I think of a text file as many separate lines of data,
as far as the computer is concerned the file is just a big collection
of characters, one after the other.  Perl can read in lines at a time
by scanning for the special delimiting return characters, but changing
it another story - one that involves much copying of data to make
space for the data you're adding in or to remove the space the data you
took out was taking up.

What we need is a module that takes away the pain of dealing with a file
and understands that if we want to insert a line, then it should silently
do all the copying and manipulating and all the other complex stuff we
don't want to think of ourselves for us.

This is where B<Tie::File> is useful.  It lets us treat a file just as
if it was a big array of lines that we can manipulate at will.
Suddenly, editing files becomes trivial and we don't have to worry
about all the things that suddenly seemed so hard before.  Isn't this
what Perl modules are all about?

B<Tie::File> uses Perl's tie interface.  This means that we 'tie' an
object to a data structure - in this case an array.  Every time we do
something to the array rather than manipulating a real array it calls
methods on the object.  In the case of B<Tie::File> this object
manipulates the underlying file that we're editing.

Each entry in the array represents a single line of the file, so
removing or adding lines removes or adds lines to the file, and
changing lines changes the corresponding line in the file.

  #!perl
  #!/usr/bin/perl

  # turn on Perl's safety features
  use strict;
  use warnings;</pre>

  # tie the file 'file' to the array '@file'.  From this point
  # on the lines of 'file' are the entries in @file and vice versa
  use Tie::File;
  tie my @file, "Tie::File", "file";

  # add a line to the end of the file
  push @file, "Program starting at: ".time

Note how we don't bother ending the string we're pushing onto the
array with a new line character - there's no need, each line is a new
line in itself.  However having said that, ending the line with a
'superfluous' newline is also perfectly acceptable - it'll just be
silently removed.  So:>

  #!perl
  # add a line to the end of the file
  push @file, "Program starting at: ". time . "\n";

Would have be equally okay.  We can also read in lines as you
might expect:

   #!perl
   print "The last line of the file is: $file[-1]\n";

While adding a line to the end of a file isn't that complicated
consider adding data to the start of a file.  With <b>Tie::File</b> it's
this simple:

  #!perl
  # add a line to the start of the file
  unshift @file, "Program Log";

This is a much harder operation to code in straight Perl.  If you want
to add data to the start of the file the simplest way to do this is to
create a new file, write the line to it, copy the whole contents of
the old file onto the end of the new file, then rename it to be the
same name as the original file.  The code to do that is:

 #!perl
 use IO::AtomicFile;
 use IO::File;</pre>

 # open the files one for reading and one for writing
 my $original = IO::File->;new("file")
   or die "Can't write to 'file': $!";
 my $changed  = IO::AtomicFile->;new("file",">")
   or die "Can't write to 'file.TMP': $!";

 # add the line
 print {$changed} "Program Log\n";

 # copy the rest of the data
 print {$changed} $_ while (&lt;$original&gt;);

And that's with B<IO::AtomicFile> doing the renaming of the file when
we're done writing it for us!  You can can see how much easier
B<Tie::File> is making our life already.  Changing lines in the middle
of files can be even more problematic, however with B<Tie::File> we can
simply rewrite individual lines by changing the contents of the array
for that line:

  #!perl
  # change the 13th line to say it's unlucky
  $file[12] = "I'm unlucky, oh woe is me";

  # change every mention of Christmas to Xmas in the 10th line
  $file[9] =~ s/Christmas/Xmas/gi;

In the last line of the above example we see a substitution showing
that we can read data in and write new data out and B<Tie::File> deals
with all the complexities for us.  Even better that this, we can make
use of some little known but very useful feature of Perl's C<foreach>
loop to do the same kind of substitution over the entire file:

  #!perl
  # run over '@file' making '$line' the current line each loop
  foreach my $line (@file)
  {
    print "Old line was: $line\n";
 
    # change the line
    $line =~ s/Christmas/Xmas/gi;</pre>

    print "New line is: $line\n";
  }

Because C<$line> isn't assigned the value of the element of C<@file>
we're dealing with - it I<is> the line - it's an I<implicit alias>,
changing C<$line> will actually change the original element in
C<@file> which in reality will change the line in the file.

Adding lines and deleting lines in the middle of the file with
B<Tie::File> is a little harder than simply editing them - mostly
because we get to use the oft misunderstood C<splice>  operator on the
array (though it's a lot easier than trying to read it in and write it
out again.)  To remove lines with splice we simply need to state the
array, the index of what we want to remove and how many lines we want
to remove.

  #!perl
  # remove the 10th line from the file
  splice @file, 9, 1;

  # remove the 12th, 13th and 14th line from the file
  splice @file, 11, 3;

To replace lines from the file we simply add in replacement lines
at the end of the splice operation.

  #!perl
  # remove the 12th, 13th and 13th line from the file
  # and replace the three of them with two new lines
  splice @file, 11, 3, "First Replacement Line",
                       "Second Replacement Line";

To just insert lines instead of replacing them all we need to do is
set the third argument to C<splice> - the number of lines to be
removed - to zero.

  #!perl
  # insert two lines after the 11th line before the 12th
  splice @file, 11, 0, "First Replacement Line",
                       "Second Replacement Line";

=head2 Under The Hood

Of course, B<Tie::File> actually has to manipulate the file itself
somewhat like we described in the long winded example above.  In order
to do this with some semblance of efficiency it will attempt to cache
a little (but not too much) of the file in memory.  You can control
how much memory it will use when you tie the file:

 #!perl
 # use lots and lots of memory
 tie @file, 'Tie::File', $file, memory => 20_000_000;

One trick that you might want to employ if you've got multiple programs
running at the same time is to turn off all this caching.  This will cause
the program to read the file every time you read from the array - vital
if another program may have written to it and cached data might be wrong
by now.

 #!perl
 # don't cache - other programs may be writing to 
 # the file so our cached data might be wrong!
 tie @file, 'Tie::File', $file, memory => 0;

If you're interested in having multiple files access the file you should
take a look at B<Tie::File>'s C<flock> method.

There's lots of other good features that B<Tie::File> offers.  One
wonderful feature is deferred writing, where changes aren't written to
disk immediately.  This is useful if you're editing the same parts of
the file over and over (so the changes only have to be written once)
but of course raises issues like what happens if your program crashes
before the write cache is flushed.  More details on this and other features
are in the wonderful manual page.
