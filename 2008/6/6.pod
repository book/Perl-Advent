It's the time of the year for caroling, and that means everyone's favorite
B<The Twelve Days of Christmas>.
Being a
A<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_song|cumulative song>,
we'd like a shortcut for constructing each verse, which boils down to
a function (lines 3-8)
that simply generates the form:

=begin pre

On the ? day of Christmas my true love gave to me
        ...,
        and a partridge in a pear tree.

=end pre


M<Sub::Curry> will allow us to call that function for the current verse (line 12), and then create a new function (line 13), which includes the prose to date, to use for the next verse.

The C<HOLE> and C<BLACKHOLE>
A<http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Sub::Curry#Currying|curry-constants>
create a way to prepend our arguments to generate the correct order; alternativelyN<1> we could C<curry($fn,$lyric)> and have C<$fn> just C<reverse @_>, but this way spices things up!
Other tasty recipes can be found in the would actually be better for
A<http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Sub::Curry::Cookbook|Sub::Curry::Cookbook>.

So, putting everything together, we can <s>eat</s> sing along with the last verse as generated:

=begin pre

On the twelfth day of Christmas my true love gave to me
        twelve drummers drumming,
        eleven pipers piping,
           ten lords a-leaping,
          nine ladies dacing,
         eight maids a-milking,
         seven swans a-swimming,
           six geese a-laying,
          five golden rings,
          four calling birds,
         three french hens,
           two turtle doves,
        and a partridge in a pear tree.

=end pre

Of course, simple loop/array solutions work as well; but TMTOWTDI and fun/holiday cheer is as a good reason as any!
