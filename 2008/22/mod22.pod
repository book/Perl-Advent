How often have you mangled a document with B<-i>nline editing
like the first block in our code sample? That's what B<-i~> is for of course,
but if you forget, the damage is done. Often, it may be possible to work around
such difficulties as in blocks two and three, but what if you haven't stemmed
or grepped all the text in the document to look for possible substr conflicts?
You're in a rush and have no desire to muck with boundaries and
look-aheads/behinds&hellip; You just just want a nice, simple, DWIMmy,
explicit text replacement. M<Regexp::Subst::Parallel> to the rescue.
<tt>subst</tt> is a small parser that accepts multiple pairs of strings or
regular expressions to locate, and a string or B</e>xpr (n&eacute; C<CODEREF>)
to replace matches with. The easy to mistype function then manages to perform
the substitutions in a sane manner, regardless of order specified. This code
lends itself to solving more complex problems, and can even serve as a basic
templating engine.
