Apologies for calendar spottiness. Crummy term papers are finally in,
and we now return you to your regularly scheduled programming.

<tt>DynaLoader</tt> makes the use of giant C libraries like the POSIX module
a lot less hairy by only loading those functions you use/request, as opposed
to only exposing those you request as is the case with a traditional import.
That's interesting and all, but XS is so arcane. What about us mortals?

After reading P<2008-12|Friday's> entry, I thought to myself that there ought
to be some simple way of consolidating the examples into a single script that
wouldn't load unnecessary code. At this point I rediscovered M<SelfLoader>,
a pure perl analog to <tt>DynaLoader</tt>. M<SelfLoader> provides deferred
compilation (and some of the potential pitfalls that entails) of rarely used
code and is ideal for large libraries; where, it seems to this author, it is
unfortunately underused. This magic is achieved through C<AUTOLOAD> and
string C<eval>, meaning we are also able to defer dependencies with no extra
effort if they are C<use>d where needed e.g; lines 65 &amp; 74. An additional
feature&mdash;of debatable merit some would argue&mdash;when using
M<SelfLoader> to provide for minimal loading and export of a library's
functions is that because it uses C<AUTOLOAD>, one needn't bother with
potentially long and cumbersome import lists.

A few other adjustments, and this single script is ready for primetime
on both barebones servers and decked-out desktops alike.
