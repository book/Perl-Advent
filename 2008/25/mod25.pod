<div style="width:987px"><div style="float:left; width:360px;"> As frequent
readers of the calendar may have noticed, I'm a sucker for P<2005-25|text-art>
and "P<2007-18|ANSI-mation>," so it's no surprise I bring you more text toys
today. The author of M<Term::Animation>, a library which provides facilities
for sprite-based animation. With it he has produced "screensavers" like this

A<http://www.robobunny.com/projects/asciiquarium/html/|aquarium>, although one
could produce all sorts of games too, or vingettes like our example:</div>
