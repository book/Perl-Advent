For all its magic, P&egrave;re No&euml;l's sack is just a big velvet bag, and
sometimes things get a little mixed up. On top of that, with the variety of
toys that exist today&mdash;gone are the days of dollies or pop guns&mdash;he
can't always figure out what's what. Therefore, he keeps a little app on his
PDA to check that a toy is culturally appropriate; children may play with
identical toys around the world, but the packaging and directions can vary.
A simplified version of this tool, featuring M<Lingua::Ident>, is shown below.
