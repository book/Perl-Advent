Recently, I gave a talk for the A<http://boston.pm.org|local PerlMongers> on "A Magic Number Mystery Tour of Use.perl.org journals with pack and unpack" (A<magic_pack_tour.pdf|pdf>). In summary, time() and time_t take all longint values, so some time is C<011111111111> or C<1234567890> or C<'Bill'> o'clock. Earlier on Thursday was (net byte order) C<'IAGO'> o'clock.

During Santa's flight, there are several interesting times -

While I could use A<http://www.thinkgeek.com/homeoffice/lights/a7c5/|The ThinkGeek Epoch Clock> 

<a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/homeoffice/lights/a7c5"><image src="http://www.thinkgeek.com/images/products/additional/large/a7c5_thinkgeek_clock_front.jpg"></a> 

to track this, it won't arrive by 6am today and besides it support  Roman numerals,  which I don't need, but it can not display the time_t in octal, hex, and ascii that I want, only the hh,mm,ss. (Perl can do A<http://search.cpan.org/search?query=roman&mode=module|Roman Numbers> too.)

The Core features C<Time::HiRes>, C<Term::Cap>, C<un/pack> let us prototype quickly for command line.

But that's pretty dull in comparison to ThinkGeeks' lovely black monolith.

I would like to try a Tk gui on Perl. But doing Perl and PerlAdvent on my laptop has been a challenge this week, so I was not optimistic. A kernel security patch disconfigured my wifi, so I bit the bullet and upgraded to A<http://www.ubuntu.com/|Ubuntu Intrepid Ibex> 8.10 Linux. I forgot that this would break my PerlAdvent tools of P<2007-17> M<Pod::Advent> and P<2006-5> M<Ack>, since they were built C<perl Makefile,PL && make && make test && sudo make install> with C</bin/perl>, 5.8.x.  Ubuntu Intrepid Ibex sensibly moved up to the year old Perl 5.10 P<2007-19>. Oops, nothing works except core modules. 

A quick C<cpan Tk> (once it's configured right again) lets me load one of the two portable GUI libs for Perl (the other is M<Wx>). It's test pops up windows, this is a very good sign. It has a C<timer> demo, which I can wed to the CLI clock script as

Not too bad!

Did you notice what time it is today?

Coincidence?
