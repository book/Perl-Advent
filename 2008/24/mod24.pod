The awkwardly named M<Sort::Half::Maker> is a pretty interesting little chunk
of code. A one-off developed by the author to dump data with important keys
first, it allows you to "sort by example" as in our code sample which yields:

=begin pre

Rudolph,Dasher,Dancer,Prancer,Vixen,Comet,Cupid,Dunder,Blixem,Chet,Olive

=end pre

Other uses for it might be to ensure that in a sorted list of contestants,
those who placed sort accordingly, while everyone else sorts alphabetically;
perhaps with no-shows or disqualified individuals bringing up the rear.
This would require a multi-step sort where placed contestants are sorted by
rank into a C<start>, whose results are then referenced by the &frac12; maker.
