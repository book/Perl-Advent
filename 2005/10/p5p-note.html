tchrist&gt; This is what Ken invented cmp for, guys.  Sheesh.<BR>
<P>
bradapp&gt;Surely you aren't referring to the 'cmp' in File::Compare, because<BR>
bradapp&gt;this entire cmpxxxx() functions subthread is precisely about fixing<BR>
bradapp&gt;various portability/configurability problems with the 'cmp' from<BR>
bradapp&gt;that package (sheesh ;-)
<P>
bradapp&gt;Or did you mean some other cmp???
</I>
<P>
You guys are busily bending over backwards and further, just to
avoid invoking standard, expected, and fundamentally basic tools in
an altogether laudable effort to enhance portability to even those
legacy, tool-deficient systems that the underprivileged, unfortunate,
and sometimes simply unwary masses have been cursed to toil under.
<P>
This is good, for their need is great.  Suffering is bad.
<P>
But don't stop there!  Don't merely implement a cat module, a cmp
module, an ls module, a tee module, a basename module, a grep module,
a head module, a find module, a cp module, an rm module, etc., as you
are currently doing.  Turn these all into the real programs, and put
that directory of them in one's path, and you will have given the world
a small gift of great joy.
<P>
This modest act, hitherto unaddressed by the mighty Module::Gods, would
cause tremendous cheers to go up by simple toolsmiths and toolaholics
everywhere.  It would do a far greater service than mere fancy-dancy
modules by themselves ever would.  That's because it would be real
programs usable not just by ultra-elite superprogrammers, but by regular
humans with simple needs.  It would instantly enhance portability of
Perl scripts in general and build environments in particular, without
the beleaguered programmer having to lift a tired finger.
<P>
In loving memory of RSTS/E, which more than a decade past first showed
Larry and me how nifty it was to use a high-level language (that would
be BASIC-PLUS) for systems programming and whence Perl derives some of
its mindset and even a wee bit of its featureset, let us now therefore
set forth to create a distribution of small Perl programs comprising
that most basic and fundamental of toolsets, the one that every loyal
acolyte of the Interchangeable Way expects to be there but comes up
empty-handed and despairing.  These old companions would suddenly
be there as a continual source of comfort for the heretofore lonely
hacker in his perilous journey deep into the acid heart of the Desert
of Redmond, and beyond.  A free, purely Perlian /bin-emulation suite of
tinytools would shine in spiffiness, synergy, security, and of course,
effect at last that nominally noblest of goals: ubiquitous portability.
<P>
And it would make nice press for Perl, too, eh?
<P>
Modules without programs are slightly silly -- solipsistic soliloquies.
But cloak these modules in honest tools, and surely shall your names
be written in the Blessed Book of Courageous Coders who helped save
the world.
<P>
The geas is set.  May the contributions begin.  Happy hacking!
<P>
