I got interested in understanding how Unicode works for two reasons: I needed
to understand it to do my job, and it gave me an improved ability to do
L<stupid things on Twitter|https://twitter.com/rjbs/status/149640554597199872>.
Mostly, today I want to talk about the latter.

So, for example, how did I make that stupid section header above?  (By the way,
if you can't read it, you should probably go install a more complete Unicode
font, like Symbola!)  Well, I knew that Unicode 6 had introduced Fraktur
characters, and if I knew how they were named, I could start from there, so I
used the C<uni> command provided with L<App::Uni>:

  #!code
  $ uni fraktur
  1D504 𝔄 MATHEMATICAL FRAKTUR CAPITAL A
  1D505 𝔅 MATHEMATICAL FRAKTUR CAPITAL B
  1D507 𝔇 MATHEMATICAL FRAKTUR CAPITAL D
  1D508 𝔈 MATHEMATICAL FRAKTUR CAPITAL E
  1D509 𝔉 MATHEMATICAL FRAKTUR CAPITAL F
  1D50A 𝔊 MATHEMATICAL FRAKTUR CAPITAL G
  ...

This a stupidly useful tool for being a goofball.  Did you know that I mostly
use my programming skills to make dumb jokes on the internet?  Yeah, this is
your surprised face: 😐

  #!code
  $ uni neutral
  A64E Ꙏ CYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER NEUTRAL YER
  A64F ꙏ CYRILLIC SMALL LETTER NEUTRAL YER
  1F610 😐 NEUTRAL FACE

=head1 The 𝑁𝑒𝑥𝑡 Level

So, C<uni> is great for finding characters quickly by name.  Sometimes, though,
you want to find characters based on other criteria.  For example, when I see
somebody trying to use C<m{\d}> to match ASCII digits, I want to give them an
example of some of the things that they really don't think should be matched.
Tom Christiansen is one of Perl's chief Unicode gurus, and he's written a bunch
of weird and useful tools.  brian d foy packaged those up and now it's easy for
anybody to install them.  One of the tools is C<unichars>, which lets you find
characters based on many more criteria than their names.  For example, to
enlighten the guy using C<m{\d}>, I want to find digits that aren't in C<[0-9]>
and I'm going to pick the seven from each script, because seven is a funny
number:

  #!code
  $ unichars '\d' '$_ !~ /[0-9]/' 'NAME =~ /SEVEN/'
  ...
  ७  U+096D DEVANAGARI DIGIT SEVEN
  ৭  U+09ED BENGALI DIGIT SEVEN
  ੭  U+0A6D GURMUKHI DIGIT SEVEN
  ૭  U+0AED GUJARATI DIGIT SEVEN
  ୭  U+0B6D ORIYA DIGIT SEVEN
  ௭  U+0BED TAMIL DIGIT SEVEN
  ౭  U+0C6D TELUGU DIGIT SEVEN
  ೭  U+0CED KANNADA DIGIT SEVEN
  ൭  U+0D6D MALAYALAM DIGIT SEVEN
  ๗  U+0E57 THAI DIGIT SEVEN
  ໗  U+0ED7 LAO DIGIT SEVEN
  ...

I just specified my three criteria as arguments to the command:

=for :list
* a digit: C<\d>
* not in [0-9]: C<$_ !~ /[0-9]/>
* seven: C<NAME =~ /SEVEN/>

You could also replace that second rule with, say, C<'\P{ASCII}'>.  There's
more than one way to do it.  There are some important things to know, though.
By default, for example, C<unichars> won't search the supplementary
multilingual plane or the so-called "astral" plane.  That means that this vital
search will fail:

  #!code
  $ unichars 'NAME =~ /WEARY/'
  (nothing)

You meant:

  #!code
  $ unichars -a 'NAME =~ /WEARY/'
  😩  U+1F629 WEARY FACE
  🙀  U+1F640 WEARY CAT FACE

Also, the sophistication of C<unichars> comes at a price: speed.  Searching for
that weary cat face with C<uni> takes about 0.144s on my laptop.  Searching
with C<unichars>, 14.899.

When you're just trying to make a stupid joke on Twitter, those 14 seconds
aren't worth spending.  On the other hand, when you need to actually search for
characters matching certain criteria, C<unichars> can do it, and C<uni> can't.

=head1 Two More Tools

Unicode::Tussle comes with a bunch more tools, but I'll just show you two more,
briefly.  C<uninames> is a bit more like C<uni> in that its primary job is to
search character descriptions, but its searches aren't limited to character
I<names>.  It looks at the whole description.  For example:

  #!code
  $ uninames face
   ∯  222F  SURFACE INTEGRAL
    # 222E 222E
   ⌓  2313  SEGMENT
    = position of a surface
   ⌚  231A  WATCH
    x (alarm clock - 23F0)
    x (clock face one oclock - 1F550)
   ⏰  23F0 ALARM CLOCK
    x (watch - 231A)
    x (clock face one oclock - 1F550)
  ...
   ☺  263A  WHITE SMILING FACE
    = have a nice day!

We get C<SURFACE INTEGRAL> because it matches C</face/i>, but why do we get
C<SEGMENT> or C<WATCH>?  It's because they're related to character with "face"
in their descriptions.  Sometimes, you'll get a match against a comment about
the characters' usage:

  #!code
  $ uninames fraktur
   ſ  017F  LATIN SMALL LETTER LONG S
     * in common use in Roman types until the 18th century
     * in current use in Fraktur and Gaelic types
  ...

Finally, there's C<uniprops>.  This is a I<wonderfully> useful tool, in I<very
limited circumstances>.  Most often, for me, it comes up when I've got some
weird input.  Say some user's name isn't working with some data validator.  The
guy who wrote that validator required names to be (for some insane reason)
Latin letters that were either uppercase or lowercase.  Our other input
validator only has the first half of that constraint: Latin letters.  What's
happening?  Well, the user causing us problems is going by the name “ᴿᴶᴮˢ” –
what can C<uniprops> tell us about those?

  #!code
  ~$ uniprops <1d3f>
  U+1D3F ‹ᴿ› \N{MODIFIER LETTER CAPITAL R}
      \w \pL \p{L_} \p{Lm}
      All Any Alnum Alpha Alphabetic Assigned InPhoneticExtensions Case_Ignorable
         CI Cased Changes_When_NFKC_Casefolded CWKCF Dia Diacritic L Lm Gr_Base
         Grapheme_Base Graph GrBase ID_Continue IDC ID_Start IDS Letter L_ Latin
         Latn Modifier_Letter Lower Lowercase Phonetic_Extensions Print Word
         XID_Continue XIDC XID_Start XIDS X_POSIX_Alnum X_POSIX_Alpha
         X_POSIX_Graph X_POSIX_Lower X_POSIX_Print X_POSIX_Word

So, it's Latin, a Letter, and Lowercase, but not a Lowercase_Letter.  What??
Surely this is an anomaly..?  We can find out with C<unichars>!

  #!code
  $ unichars '\p{Letter}' '\P{Lowercase_Letter}' '\P{Uppercase_Letter}' '\p{Latin}'
  (131 characters listed)

What's the lesson here?  You and the other guy should learn what those
categories I<mean>.  Once you've started doing that, you'll be well on your way
down the rabbit hole, and you'll start to find all new uses for these tools…
but none is likely to be as much fun as making stupid Tweets.
